### MinIO setup   
Please follow [minio documentation](https://docs.min.io/docs/minio-quickstart-guide.html) to set your server !  
In case of troubleshooting you can follow this command line to set your server to a static address  
`minio server --address 127.0.0.1:9000 destination folder path`  
You will be redirected to MinIO console, where you should set your credentials info (check your RootUser and RootPass in your command line).
